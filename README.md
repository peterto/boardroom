Boardroom
=========
Inspired by [Twilio's Stashboard](https://github.com/twilio/stashboard), we've ported their Python app into a Ruby on Rails app.

There's also an API implemented within this app (JSON)


Technology used
===============
* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [jQuery/JavaScript] (http://jquery.com/) for some long polling
* [bootstrap-sass] (https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass) for making it look nice
* [postgres] (http://www.postgresql.org/) for our database
* [rspec] (http://rspec.info/) for testing
* [capybara] (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) for requests testing
* [devise] (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication
* [heroku] (http://www.heroku.com/)
